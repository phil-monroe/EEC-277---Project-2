Problem:

Two-person groups: For the above codes, contrast the performance of a "traditional" CUDA/OpenCL program that launches many more blocks than the GPU can run at any one time vs. a "persistent threads" program that launches only the exact number of blocks as there are multiprocessors on your GPU and streams all data through them. For instance, if you have 1M items to process, you might in a traditional CUDA program launch 1M threads. In a persistent-threads program, you might determine that your GPU has 8 multiprocessors and then launch 256 threads on each of the 8 multiprocessors, then allow each of those threads to process 1000 elements. You can find more info about this approach online; a good paper reference is "Understanding the Efficiency of Ray Traversal on GPUs" by Aila and Laine in High Performance Graphics 2009.
