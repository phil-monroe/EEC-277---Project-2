Problem:

Write a program that characterizes the number of thread blocks vs. performance (performance as a function of thread blocks). From this you should be able to determine how many hardware thread-block processors ("multiprocessors") your hardware has. I have not tried this, but I believe that if you declare a >8 KB partition of shared memory per block, that you will guarantee that only one block is running at a time on a multiprocessor. (Keep it under 16k though, since CUDA reserves a few bytes to hold arguments to kernels etc.)
