Problem:

Finally, write a program that characterizes the performance of a computationally-intense program as a function of branch granularity. By that I mean how much does the performance drop as branching increases? The tricky thing about this part of the assignment is how to write code that will branch each thread in a different direction. In general, you'd prefer to use code that is computationally heavy, so uses many math instructions for example. Be careful though: the compiler is very smart at defeating you and detecting how to make code more efficient. If you do "if (foo) bar() else bar()" it will detect that and optimize away the branch.
